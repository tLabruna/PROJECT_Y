They offer a seasonal menu with festive dishes, and it's moderately priced. However, I'd like to check availability for you. Let me just check... Ah, yes! I can book a table for you. Your reservation number is 456. Would you like me to confirm the details?"

They do offer a variety of sweet and savory treats, but it's not a Chinese restaurant.\n\nIf you'd like, I can suggest some other options for you. Perhaps you'd like to try the Wok Express, which is a Chinese restaurant in Cambridge? Or maybe the Peking Restaurant? Let me know if you'd like more info on either of those options."
