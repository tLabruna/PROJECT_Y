As for the price range, it's listed as \"cheap\", but I should note that this might not be entirely accurate.\n\nTo give you a better idea, I can suggest some alternative seafood options in Cambridge that are more clearly listed as upscale or casual, and have a more specific price range. For example, \"Loch Fyne\" at The Little Rose, 37 Trumpington Street, is a seafood restaurant with a more upscale atmosphere and a price range of \"expensive\". Would you like more information about this option?"
