But I can suggest a few options that serve finger foods or small plates that might fit what you're looking for.\n\nOne option is the City Stop Restaurant, located in the north part of town. They serve a variety of small plates and snacks, including some international dishes. However, I don't see any specific mention of canap\u00e9s on their menu.\n\nAnother option is the Cambridge Lodge Hotel Restaurant, which is located in the west part of town, but close to the north part. They serve a range of small plates and snacks, including some British and international dishes.\n\nIf you're willing to venture a bit further, you could also try the Hotel Felix's Graffiti restaurant, which is located in the west part of town. They serve a range of small plates and snacks, including some international dishes.\n\nPlease note that these options may not specifically serve canap\u00e9s, but they do offer a variety of small plates and snacks that might fit what you're looking for. If you'd like more information or have any other questions, feel free to ask!\n\nReservation number: 1234"
