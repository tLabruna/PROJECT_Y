However, I can suggest you check online review sites such as TripAdvisor or Yelp to see if there are any hidden gems that I'm not aware of.\n\nIf you're willing to consider other international cuisines, I can suggest a few options from the Knowledge Base. For example, there's a restaurant called \"Grafton Hotel Restaurant\" that serves British cuisine, or \"Hotel Felix's Graffiti\" that serves European cuisine. Alternatively, you could try \"Regent Street City Centre\" which has a restaurant serving North American cuisine.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like more information about any of these options."
