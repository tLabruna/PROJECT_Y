Would you like me to suggest those instead?"

Restaurant City and - They're located in the heart of the city, and they serve up delicious Portuguese cuisine. It's a bit on the pricier side, but definitely worth a try.\n2. Golden Palace Pizzeria - This one's a bit of a hidden gem. They're not just a pizzeria, they also serve up great Portuguese dishes. And they're located in the city centre, so it's easy to get to.\n3. Little Palace Restaurant - This one's a bit more upscale, but the food is amazing. They have a great selection of Portuguese dishes, and the atmosphere is really cozy.\n4. Ugly River - This one's a bit more laid back, but the food is still top-notch. They have a great selection of Portuguese dishes, and the prices are pretty reasonable.\n\nWould you like to make a reservation at one of these restaurants? I can give you a reservation number!"
