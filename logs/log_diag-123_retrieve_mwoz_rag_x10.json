Have you tried La Tasca on Bridge Street? They serve Spanish cuisine, and while they might not specialize in Basque food, they might have some dishes that fit the bill. Alternatively, you could try Da Baba at the Doubletree by Hilton Cambridge - they also serve Spanish food, and might have some Basque-inspired options.\n\nWould you like to reserve a table at one of these restaurants? I can give you a reservation number. Let's say... Reservation #R23CB. Would you like to book a table?"

For example, are you interested in a specific type of European cuisine (e.g. Italian, French, German)? Or perhaps a particular price range or location? This will help me give you a more tailored recommendation."
