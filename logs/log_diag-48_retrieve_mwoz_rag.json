However, I did find a few upscale restaurants in Cambridge that serve North American cuisine.\n\nOne option is The Bachelor, a contemporary Canadian restaurant with a focus on seasonal ingredients. They have a cozy atmosphere and a menu that changes frequently.\n\nAnother option is The Horseshoe Tavern, a historic pub that serves classic North American fare with a twist. They have a wide selection of craft beers and a lively atmosphere.\n\nWould you like to know more about either of these options?"
