However, I did find a restaurant that serves international food, which might have some Jamaican-inspired dishes.\n\nFor Portuguese food, I found a few options in the south part of town:\n\n1. **Nandos** - Located at Cambridge Leisure Park Clifton Way Cherry Hinton, CB17DY. They serve Portuguese-style chicken dishes.\n2. **Frankie and Bennys** - Located at Cambridge Leisure Park Clifton Way Cherry Hinton, CB17DY. They serve a variety of international dishes, including some Portuguese-inspired options.\n\nPlease note that these options might not be traditional Jamaican or Portuguese cuisine, but they might satisfy your cravings for international flavors.\n\nIf you'd like to book a table, you can reserve a number, for example, **Reservation 1234**. Please let me know if you'd like to book a table at one of these restaurants!"
