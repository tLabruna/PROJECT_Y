They're located in the heart of Cambridge, making it a convenient spot to grab a bite after exploring the city.\n\nWould you like to make a reservation?

Alternatively, you can try searching for restaurants that serve seafood, as Venetian cuisine often features seafood dishes.\n\nIf you'd like, I can try to find a restaurant that serves Italian or seafood cuisine. Just let me know!"
