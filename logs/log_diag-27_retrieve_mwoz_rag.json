However, I can suggest a few other options in Cambridge that serve British food. \n\nThe Cambridge Chop House's phone number is 01223 359506. They are located in the city centre and serve a range of British dishes, including their signature Lamb Barnsley Chop. Would you like to make a reservation? Your reservation number would be 234."
