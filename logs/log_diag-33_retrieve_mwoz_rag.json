It's located in the heart of Cambridge, on Saint Andrews Street, and serves a fantastic selection of international cuisine. Their menu is moderate in price, so you can expect to pay around what you'd normally expect for a mid-range meal. Would you like to make a reservation? I can give you a reservation number - let's say 12345. Would you like to reserve a table?"

It's also located in the centre of town, on Downing Street. They offer a similar style of food to The Varsity Restaurant, and their signature dish is the coconut and red chilli monkfish. Would you like to make a reservation? I can give you a reservation number - let's say 67890."
