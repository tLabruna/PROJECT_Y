While they do offer some traditional Japanese dishes, their menu is not strictly traditional Japanese food. They're known for their creative twists on Asian classics.\n\nIf you're looking for a more authentic Japanese dining experience, you might want to consider other options. However, if you're in the mood for a modern, fusion-style Asian restaurant with a lively atmosphere, Wagamama is a great choice.\n\nWould you like to make a reservation at Wagamama? I can provide you with a reservation number."
