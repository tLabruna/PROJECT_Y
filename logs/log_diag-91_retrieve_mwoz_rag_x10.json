Peking Johns - They're a British restaurant with a Chinese twist, located in the Cambridge Leisure Park. It's a moderate-priced restaurant with a cozy atmosphere.\n2. Peking Spice - Another British restaurant with a Chinese flavor, located on Cherry Hinton Road. It's also a moderate-priced restaurant with a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nIf you'd like to reserve a table, I can give you a reservation number. Let me check... Reservation number 1234. Would you like to book a table at either of these restaurants?"
